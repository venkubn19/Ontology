# Doc_Ontology
Ontology provide users with the necessary structure to link one piece of information to other pieces of information. Pre-defined ontologies are available for various type of documents belonging to different fields.The model automates the classification of documents  based on its ontological categories. Each of the categories have their own types. The classification is based on the tf-idf weights which are generated from the corpora and vectors formed from Word2Vec. The corpora is in turn formed from the manually collected documents related to respective types of categories. The model then generates vectors for the passed query document based on the tf-idf weights obtained from the above corpora. In order to obtain the results, model applies cosine similarity to the query document and each of the documents that form the corpora for that type of category.Thus various accuracy scores will be generated which indicates the amount a particular document is talking about each category.
